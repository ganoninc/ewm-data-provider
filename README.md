Emoji Weather Map Data Provider

This small PHP program is a proxy between [Emoji Weather Map](https://github.com/ganoninc/emojis-weather-map) and OpenWeatherMap API. 

It exists for mainly two reasons:
* to hide my OpenWeatherMap API private key
* to cache data in order to reduce API calls and keep using this awesome API for free.
